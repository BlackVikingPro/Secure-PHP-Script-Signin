#PHP Secure Script

One page element used for basic, secure authentication using php.
PHP is server-side, as you all know, so it can't be seen in the source.
Perfect way to weed out hackers.

Use this page to secure certain information or maybe an admin console.
Whatever you like :D

[ User: my-user | Pass: my-pass ]
(Obviously this page does nothing in the demo.)
