# PHP Secure Script
One page script collection used for basic, secure authentication using PHP.

## Script-Specs:
 * [Multi-Accounts](multi-accounts.php) - Supports multiple user:pass accounts.
 * [Single-Pass-Auth](single-pass-auth.php) - Single master password, basic auth.
 * [Improved Security](improved-sec.php) - Single master password, advanced security.

## Purpose
This is a simple collection of one-page authentication scripts to protect any single page
worth of PHP/HTML and whatever have you. These scripts are not designed for production, so I recommend against using them in such environment, as they may contain vulnerabilities or limitations that I'm not aware of. 

## Issues
As with all GitHub repositories, you may submit an [issue](https://github.com/BlackVikingPro/Secure-PHP-Script-Signin/issues/) detailing any bug/vuln findings or improvement recommendations. Also, feel free to [fork](http://github.com/BlackVikingPro/Secure-PHP-Script-Signin/fork) this project!
